<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>

<div id="container">
<div class="section-area" id="section1">
	<div class="sec-name" id="section-name1">PART 1</div>
	<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section-area" id="section2">
	<div class="sec-name" id="section-name2">PART 2</div>
	<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,
	</p>
</div>

<div class="section-area" id="section3">
	<div class="sec-name" id="section-name3">PART 3</div>
	<p>And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.
	I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I â€”I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.
	</p>
